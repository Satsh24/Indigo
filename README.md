Introduction:

Creating a starter application using Spring boot(Java) in the backend and ReactJS(JavaScript) for the front-end. 
First making this abstract, the features will be added as we progress.
The basic idea is to have a login and search functionalities in the app that would query and send results after being processed.
The idea can be extended to multiple cases later on.


Project Structure:

  The project follows the maven project structure and has the root folder as backend.
  
  The src has all the working related to the backend and front end of the application.
  
  backend/pom.xml			-> maven dependencies for the project.
  backend/src				-> All code related to the project.
  backend/src/main/webapp	-> Frontend code related to the project. This has been created using create-react-app
